Instead of just asking folks who they would vote for; follow up with asking what the chosen candidate has actually accomplished to directly impact the voter and/or society in a positive way.  I know the news wants to stir up controversy, but might this small step move away from emotional voting and get people to avoid choosing a candidate who looks good on camera and promises the moon.",

I wasn't sure to join this place because heard about not so nice things about some places inside it, but, decided to give it a try and see how it really is. Seems like there are genuinely good and welcoming places here!\u00a0\n\n\nI joined here because I saw there are communuties about things that interests me and I an into them like drawing, art, videogames, animation and animals. I have been learning to make art for over a year and also sharing my progress online, so it's nice to have another place to do that and find people that also love art and support each other. Also, starting to be more open to interact with people and talk to them as I am pretty shy and quiet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHope to have a good time here and it's really nice to meet you!!\u00a0",

I believe they're more expensive to make.\n\n\nJuaritos has a 12 flavor 12 pack. I picked one up at Walmart about a month ago. That can kick start your collection with a lot of unique flavors. As far as favorites fo I'm a huge fan of the local brands Ale 8-one and Cheerwine.\n\n\nIf you're interested in cans my uncle from upstate New York loved when we sent him cases of Bubba Cola from Save a Lot down south. There's all kinds of silly southern brands like Mountain Holler.",

One moment I'll be alive, the next moment is nothing, and not even the awareness that there is nothing. No darkness, no emptiness. I won't be there. Or anywhere.

I think from different perspectives with this, to try to find out which is true.\n\nLike, I think about how we can talk, and that makes me give credence to there being a spiritual reality, cause it seems so magical when I think about it, the fact that we can talk, how would that even originate? Then I think about something else that gives credence to there being an atheistic reality. I can't make my mind up.",

So we certainly have a way to go to understand mortality.\n\nTherefore it mostly comes down to beliefs and comprehension of the vastness of the possibilities.\n\nPersonally I believe our life force holds together for a while (different for everyone) and then when ready it dissipates into the primordial energy soup to go around again. \n\nI do think a little something gets left behind with our body, but it\u2019s a link with this life that the energy can revisit, like a connection with our loved ones that hangs around",

It's cold in the house too, of course. Then you lay down in your bed and pull a very comfortable thick comforter on you (imagine the most comfortable fabric you can think of) and it's fresh out of the dryer. You relax on your slowly warming pillow and get nustled in the perfect spot and then fall asleep. \n\nTo me, that's a magical moment when it happens. That's kind of what I equate death to.",
